Backend theme by Carlos Alvarez
Site: http://Alvarez.is

created a backend in the /backend/index.php . 
You can even create some fakeData to test the backend

/backend/fakeData.php (there is a test txt file with some urls, or create your own url)

Usage:
Just put the files on your server. Set the config for your usage.
You only need to have a server with MongoDB and PHP installed.
No need to create databases or collections.

Have fun!
